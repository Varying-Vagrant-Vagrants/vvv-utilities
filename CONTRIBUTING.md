# Contributing to VVV

Contributions to the VVV project are more than welcome.

## License

By contributing code to the [VVV project](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv/) and other sub-projects, you agree to license your contribution under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Issues

Issues should be opened on the main [VVV repository](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv/). Open a GitHub issue for anything. We've covered quite a bit of ground over time, so it would be helpful to search for related topics first. That said, don't worry if you find yourself opening something that sounds like it could be obvious. There is no such thing.

## Comments

Comment on any GitHub issue, open or closed. The only guidelines here are to be friendly and welcoming. If you see that a question has been asked and you think you know the answer, don't wait!

## Pull Requests

Pull Requests for VVV extensions can be submitted to this repository. Please consider opening an issue on the [VVV repository](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv/) first so that we can discuss goals and approach. If you feel more comfortable showing intent with code, then opening a pull request at the same time is more than welcome.

## Code Style

### Bash Scripting

For any shell scripting that we do in Bash — see `provision.sh` — we try to follow the style provided in Google's [Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml).

### PHP

For any PHP, we try to follow the WordPress core [code standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/).
