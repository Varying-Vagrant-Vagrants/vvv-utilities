# SSH Trusted Hosts

When you SSH to a new domain for the first time, it asks if you want to trust the fingerprint for that server. This is very useful, but in VVV there is no way to say yes/no during a provision. So this utility adds several common hosts automatically.

This utility is built in to newer versions of VVV, so isn't needed for most users.
